# Board Game Helpers

A vue based application containing helpers for various boardgames. Their utility ranges from dice rollers to searchable reference sheets

### Tools Included
- Grand Austria Hotel Reference Tool
  - Grand Austria Hotel (GAH) has such a large list of references for all of its staff, guests and expansion add-ons that the
  online community has made many printable compressed refrences sheets. However I decided to make this whole deal a lot easier 
  by converting it all to a digital format that can quickly searched and filtered.

- Wreck Raiders Dice Roller
  - Wreck Raiders has a unique dice rolling mechanic. The box lid has an inlaid graphic with several printed 'action' spots
  for dice to potentially land on, however rolling the dice in the lid can be quite loud and not ideal for many situations
  so I created this simple tool to emulate the dice rolling experience with adjustable probabilty of landing on a printed
  action spot.

- Cartographers Scoring Card Randomizer
  - With all the expansions that Cartographers offers and its modular design, it become a chore to setup the cards for whatever
  combination of expansion I felt like playing with so I made this app to do the choices for me. Much shuffling and time saved.
  Mission accomplished.
